These files include:

The group additionally employed SASS to style our theme. Incorporating SASS introduced another file structure into the themes project folder. Within Sass, the group had access to files required to manipulate and style the theme.

We added a custom menu to the footer. We also included widgets to header to allow for social media integration.

**Design decisions**

The design of the site was selected after the team voted on mock-up pages a member created. We then followed the style of the mock up but added extra content where we felt necessary.

**Colours**

The site colour palette we employed was based off one of our mock-ups. The colour combinations included are within the sass file Abstracts/variables/_colors.scss.
