**Files that would need editing**
This project incorporates a starter theme called underscores. The theme provided our group a solid foundation to build, customise and style towards our required preferences. Underscores is made up of many different files but for our project only certain file were necessary to utilize. These files include:
**footer.php** – Added code to specify where menu should be placed.
**functions.php** – Added code to access custom navigation menu.
**functions.php**- Added code to include widget in haeder
The group additionally employed SASS to style our theme. Incorporating SASS introduced another file structure into the themes project folder. Within Sass, the group had access to files required to manipulate and style the theme. These files include:
**footer.scss** – Added code to style custom navigation menu
 
**Relevant information about what features your theme has**
We added a custom menu to the footer. We also included widgets to header to allow for social media integration.

**Design decisions**
The design of the site was selected after the team voted on mock-up pages a member created. We then followed the style of the mock up but added extra content where we felt necessary.

**Colours**
The site colour palette we employed was based off one of our mock-ups. The colour combinations included are within the sass file Abstracts/variables/_colors.scss.
