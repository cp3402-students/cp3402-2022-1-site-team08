# Site Development

### Add a new Event

Make sure you have the plugin "The Events Calender" installed and activated.

Open the Events tab located below posts.

Click on the 'Add New' at the top.

Fill in the title of the event you want to add, then scroll down and fill in the time and date for the event. (The description, location and organisers forms are optional, and do not need to be filled out.)

Click on the publish button on the right.

Your event has now been added to the list shown on the events page.

To edit this event, or any others, go to the Events tab on the left to see all added events, and edit as you see fit. If you only filled in the title and the time and date, quick edit should suffice for any changes.

The Events plugin overwrites the Events page so anything written on that page will not show.

**DO NOT** delete the Events page as the plugin still needs the page there to overwrite it.

### Add new photos

Make sure the plugin "Photo Gallery" is installed and activated.

Open the Photo Gallery tab located below Settings.

Click on 'Add new gallery'.

Type in the title for your gallery (e.g 2022, an event, a new band...)

Select 'Add images'.

Click on 'Upload files'.

You can either select the folder of photos you want to import, or drag and drop the folder. If draging, make sure to drag it only into the dotted rectangle otherwise the photos will not upload.

You will see photos from other galleries in there. Ignore them. As you upload the ones you want to add, the new ones should still be selected. Click 'Add selected images to gallery' button at the bottom right.

Once you have added all the photos you want, click 'Update'.

Your gallery has now been added to the gallery list.

If you want to use that gallery on an existing or new page, go to the page editor for that page.

Add a Photo Gallery block to the page. Select what kind of gallery style you want from the options, and which gallery you wish to display from the dropdown list. Then click 'Insert into post'.

The gallery should now display on that page.

### Add photo gallery to Gallery Page

If you want to add the gallery to the Gallery page, you will need to add that gallery to a gallery group.

Select Gallery Groups from the Photo Gallery tab. 

Edit the Photos group.

Click the Add button next to the existing galleries.

Select which gallery you would like to add, and click 'Add to Gallery Group'.

Click 'Update'.

Your gallery has now been added to the Gallery page.

### Add a new band

Create a new page.

Fill in that page with the band name, history, information, galleries, and anything else you want to add.

Publish the page.

Go back to the pages tab, and select quick edit for that new page. Select 'Our Bands' as the parent. Click 'Update'.

Go to Menus, under Appearance. Drag the new band as a sub item under Our Bands.

Open Our Bands in the page editor.

Add a H3 heading with the Band name and link it to your new page.

Add a small summary/description to the band below that heading.

(Make sure the order of the bands on this page matches the order of the bands listed in the menu)

You have added a new band.

### Add a new History

Create a new post.

Fill in the post with the title, information, galleries and anything else you want to add.

Publish the post.

Go back to the posts tab, and select quick edit for that new post. Check 'history' as the category, and uncheck 'allow comments' and 'allow pings'. Click 'Update'.

Your new history is now displayed in on the 'Our History' page.
